## Wireframing
- Wireframing outlines the basic structure and layout without delving into detailed design elements like colors, font or images.

## Importance of Wireframing in the Design Process
- Clarifies Ideas and Concepts: Wireframing helps translate abstract ideas into tangible representations. It allows designers and stakeholders to visualize the layout and structure of a project early in the process

- Facilitates Communication: It serves as a communication tool among team members, clients, and stakeholders, ensuring everyone is on the same page regarding the design and functionality.

- Identifies Usability Issues: By focusing on the user interface structure, wireframing helps identify potential usability issues early on. This can include navigation problems, information hierarchy issues, and interaction flaws.

- Saves Time and Resources: Early detection of design flaws and usability issues saves time and resources that would be spent on revisions later in the design and development stages.

- Enables Easy Modifications: Making changes to a wireframe is quicker and less costly than altering a high-fidelity design or a developed product. This flexibility encourages experimentation and iterative improvement.# wireframing

## Key Elements of Wireframing
- Layout Structure: Defines the arrangement of elements on the page.
- Navigation: Shows how users will move through the site or application.
- Functionality: Outlines key functionalities and interactions.

## Types of Wireframes
- Low-Fidelity Wireframes: Simple sketches or basic digital layouts focusing on overall structure and functionality without detailed design.
- High-Fidelity Wireframes: More detailed and refined versions, often closer to the final design, including more specific layout and design elements.

## Wireframing Tools
- Figma is a design tool that allow for real time collaborating and prototyping.
- Adobe XD is a powerful design and prototyping tool that integrates well with other Adobe creative softwares.
- Sketch is a MacOS design tool popular among UI/UX designers, with a wide range of plugins for wireframing and prototyping
